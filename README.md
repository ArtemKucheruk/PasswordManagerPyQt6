# PasswordManagerPyQt6
This is a password manager app on PyQt6 with no security. Also, this is my first big project, so it is not very good.
It is a simple program with 2 databases, 
first to make a login and register accounts
second for saving passwords, that you add there

Install and open with app, where you're working with code.
Write :
pip install PyQt6 in your terminal
and it will work
write in terminal
python Reg.py or start the app from the Reg.py file
